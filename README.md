# AirPure Innovations – Air Quality Dashboard & Market Strategy

## 📊 Project Overview
“AirPure Innovations” is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities ranking among the world’s top 20 most polluted urban centers. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a strong, sustained demand for its air purifier product. Before committing to production and R&D, they need to answer some critical questions.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To develop a Power BI dashboard that helps **AirPure Innovations** make data-driven decisions based on data provided by **Dataful** for the period **2022 to 2025**.

## ✨ Key Insights

### 💡 1. PM10 & PM2.5 are the prime villains
Across southern states, PM10 and PM2.5 emerged as the most dominant pollutants post-2022—essential for filtration focus.

### 📊 2. Population ≠ Pollution... always
While mega-cities like **Delhi** & **Kolkata** suffer poor AQI, cities like **Bengaluru** & **Chennai** maintain moderate air quality—good policy and planning matter.

### 🌆 3. Focus on the North for launch
Tier 1 & Tier 2 cities in **Northern India** like **Delhi**, **Kanpur**, and **Patna** show chronic AQI degradation—ideal for purifier market entry.

### 🧒🏽👵🏻 4. Kids & seniors: highest health risk
Infants and elders show the most severe health impacts from air pollution, including stunting, asthma, and increased mortality.

### 🚘 5. EV adoption ≠ guaranteed cleaner air
States like **Punjab** and **Madhya Pradesh** with high EV adoption showed **mixed AQI results**, underlining the need for **holistic interventions**.

### 🧠 6. AQI awareness exists, but not understanding
While **85%** of urban citizens have heard of AQI, **less than half** understand it well enough to act on it—especially in rural and Tier-2/3 cities.

### ⚠️ 7. Pollution = sales spikes
During **high-pollution events like Diwali**, air purifier **search interest spikes**, showing a real-time **opportunity for demand-driven marketing**.
